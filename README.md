Youtube Recommendation Modifier

A chrome extension that gives power to the user to modify the YouTube homepage Recommendation in order to increase his/her productivity.
it is free of charge. It was created because we badly *needed* it for our own use, and we wanted to share it with the world.


Most of the time we visit YouTube, we end up wasting a lot of time because of some random recommendation on the homepage.  
The aim of this extension is to get rid of such recommendations and let the user decide their feed.
<br> </br>
It is very simple to use just select the categories which you want to have in your feed and click on submit.  
This extension unlike other extensions doesn't remove the whole feed but only removes the categories of videos which the user dont want in their feed.  

As of now the extension only works on the YouTube Homepage.
